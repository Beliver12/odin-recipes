        <h2>Description.</h2>
        <p>Think of Eggplant Parmigiana as a pasta-less vegetarian Lasagna, 
            made with thin slices of eggplant instead of pasta, layered with tomato sauce, 
            fresh basil and plenty of molten cheese. Called Parmigiana di Melanzane in Italian and known as Eggplant Parmesan in the US, 
            itâ€™s a low-carb dream come true!
