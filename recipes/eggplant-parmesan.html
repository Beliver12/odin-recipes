        <h2>Description.</h2>
        <p>Think of Eggplant Parmigiana as a pasta-less vegetarian Lasagna, 
            made with thin slices of eggplant instead of pasta, layered with tomato sauce, 
            fresh basil and plenty of molten cheese. Called Parmigiana di Melanzane in Italian and known as Eggplant Parmesan in the US, 
            it’s a low-carb dream come true!
        </p>
         <h2>10 Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 (about 350g each)
                eggplant, cut into 1cm-thick 
                slices</li>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 small brown onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
            <li>700g bottle passata</li>
            <li>500g tub smooth riccota</li>
            <li>70g(1cup) finely grated parmesan</li>
            <li>6 fresh lasagne sheets</li>
            <li>50g (1/2 cup) coarsely grated mozzarella</li>
            <li>Fresh oregano, to serve</li>
        </ul>
        <h1><em>"Steps"</em></h1>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Step 1</strong><p>
                Preheat oven to 200°C/180°C fan forced. Heat a large frying pan over medium-high heat. 
                Spray the eggplant slices with oil spray. Working in batches, cook the eggplant for 3-4 
                minutes each side or until soft and golden brown. Transfer to a plate.
            </p></li>
            <li><strong>Step 2</strong><p>
                Heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion . 
                Cook, stirring, occasionally, for 4 minutes or until softened. 
                Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 1 minute or until aromatic. Add the passata . 
                Add 1 ⁄3 cup (80ml) water to the passata bottle, swirl, and pour into the pan. Stir to combine. 
                Bring to the boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes or until reduced slightly. Season.
            </p></li>
            <li><strong>Step 3</strong><p>
                Combine the ricotta and parmesan in a bowl. Spread one third of the tomato mixture over the base of a 5cm-deep, 
                23cm ovenproof dish. Layer 2 pasta sheets over sauce, cutting to fit. Layer one third of the eggplant on top of the pasta. 
                Dot with half the ricotta mixture. Smooth the surface. Repeat with 2 pasta sheets, half the remaining tomato sauce, half the remaining eggplant and remaining ricotta mixture. 
                Top with remaining pasta sheets and eggplant. Top with remaining tomato mixture.
            </p></li>
            <li><strong>Step 4</strong><p>
                Cover with foil and bake for 30 minutes. Uncover, sprinkle with mozzarella and bake for a further 20 minutes or until golden brown. 
                Stand for 10 minutes. Sprinkle with fresh oregano to serve.
            </p></li>
        </ol>
